We learned a lot about csv's and databases and ways to share our work and the scripts used in getting there.
Ideally we wanted that final "Pollution.csv" to be ordered by year but at the moment I'm tired of fighting
with it.  Maybe I'll come back to it or Thomas Laws or Grace cracks it, but for now they're in whatever
order they feel like and I'm not happy about it.  Can't make heads or tails of how things get ordered when
creating tables with unions in SQL.
